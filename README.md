### Cat-Dog-Classifier

 Developed a deep learning model to classify cat and dog images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
 
● Implemented a CNN architecture with TensorFlow & Keras, leveraging Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dropout layers.

● Processed and augmented a large-scale dataset (~1GB from Kaggle) to improve model generalization.

● Optimized training using EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau, enhancing performance and reducing overfitting.
